## Circus

A small game where the player solves math and/or speed based problems.

## Gameplay

The players will press any key to start the game. There will be a brief statement at the top of the screen outlining the instructions for the following question. Once ready, the player can press any key to begin the problem, and depending on the nature of the problem there will be a timer which starts couning immediately. The player must then enter an answer in a way specified by the problem - for example, by entering one or more sets of numbers or characters, or simply by pressing a button. Most problems will feature a time limit by which the player must enter their answers; otherwise a large score penalty will be applied. There are many different types of questions which the player may receive.

## Scoring

Each question generally has a score range of 0-1000 points. Points are given based on correctness of answer, accuracy, and speed (usually some combination of these). A good score is generally around 600-700 points, although the points may not be perfectly calibrated for all games - this is done based on the developer's preferences - and the inherent randomness in the questions indicates that this should be interpreted as a consistent long-term average.

## Environment

The program was written in Codelite and compiled with g++ in Windows 10 with MinGW 5.1.0.
